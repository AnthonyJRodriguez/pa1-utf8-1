Question 1 - UTF-32 vs. UTF-8: UTF-32 uses 4 bytes per character, making it simple to calculate string lengths and access characters quickly, but it wastes space on common ASCII characters. UTF-8 saves space by using 1 to 4 bytes per character, depending on the character, but random access takes longer because each character's size varies. UTF-32 is faster in random access, whereas UTF-8 is better for memory conservation, particularly in ASCII-heavy text.

Question 2 - Tradeoffs of the "10" prefix in UTF-8: The "10" prefix in UTF-8 continuation bytes distinguishes them from the beginning of new characters, reducing errors and simplifying decoding. Without this prefix, programs may misinterpret multi-byte sequences as single-byte characters, resulting in data errors. This structure helps to detect errors and ensures that text is properly parsed. While it uses a few bits, it ensures reliable processing and prevents data corruption.
